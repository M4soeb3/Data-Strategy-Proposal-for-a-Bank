# Data-Strategy-Proposal-for-a-Bank

Project: Develop a Data Strategy to Transition from Data Scaling to Data Progressive
Description: Create a strategic plan for a hypothetical bank to enhance its data capabilities.
Tasks to Include:
Assess the current state of data maturity using the IPTOP framework.
Identify gaps in infrastructure, tools, and data literacy.
Propose actionable steps for improvement, such as upskilling programs or data discovery tools.
Highlight how these changes could improve decision-making and customer service.
Skills Demonstrated: Strategic planning, data audit, organizational development, and communication skills.

Step 1: Data Maturity Assessment
Evaluate the current state of the bankâ€™s data maturity using a Data Maturity Assessment Tool. This assessment will cover:

Infrastructure: How data is stored, accessed, and integrated across the organization.
People: The level of data literacy and analytics skills among staff.
Tools: Availability of data management, analysis, and reporting tools.
Organization: Structure of the data team and how they interact with other teams.
Processes: Data governance policies, data quality standards, and workflow automation.

Step 2: Identify Gaps in Each Pillar
Analyze each pillar to identify specific gaps or areas needing improvement.

Sample Analysis
Infrastructure: Data is siloed in different departments, with limited accessibility.
People: Low data literacy and limited availability of data analysts.
Tools: Primarily spreadsheets, minimal use of data visualization and BI tools.
Organization: No centralized data team; data management is ad-hoc.
Processes: Lack of standardized data governance policies and data quality checks.

Step 3: Formulate a Data Strategy
Based on the gaps identified, propose a data strategy to transition the bank to the Data Progressive stage. Use the IPTOP framework for structured recommendations.

Sample Recommendations
Infrastructure

Goal: Centralize data storage to enable a single source of truth.
Action: Implement a data warehouse solution (e.g., AWS Redshift or Google BigQuery).
Expected Outcome: Enhanced data accessibility and integration across departments.
People

Goal: Increase data literacy and analytics capabilities.
Action: Implement a data upskilling program to train employees in data analysis, visualization, and basic statistics.
Expected Outcome: Higher quality data-driven decision-making at all levels.
Tools

Goal: Upgrade data analysis and reporting tools.
Action: Invest in BI tools like Tableau or Power BI for interactive dashboards and reporting.
Expected Outcome: Enhanced ability to visualize data insights and make data accessible to non-technical users.
Organization

Goal: Establish a centralized data team.
Action: Create a data team responsible for managing data strategy, data quality, and governance.
Expected Outcome: Improved coordination, efficiency, and accountability in data handling.
Processes

Goal: Develop standardized data governance policies.
Action: Implement data quality standards and regular audits to monitor data compliance.
Expected Outcome: Higher data quality and compliance with regulatory requirements.
